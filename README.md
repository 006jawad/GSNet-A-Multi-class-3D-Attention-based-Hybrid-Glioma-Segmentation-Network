# GSNet

For Glioma segmentation, we proposed GSNet, an end-to-end encoder-decoder-based segmentation network. In contrast to traditional 2-dimensional Unet-shaped structures, our proposed GSNet directly handles three-dimensional (3D) data while leveraging Attention-based skip links between the encoder and decoder. The network is trained and validated on the BraTS 2020 dataset before being compared to the BraTS 2019 and BraTS 2018 datasets.
